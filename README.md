#cake-or-death

Is it cake? ðŸŽ‚ Or is it death? ðŸ’€

(Just a silly first attempt at publishing my own package to npm)

Inspired by Suzy Eddie Izzard's [Cake or Death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZVjKlBCvhg)

__Recommended usage in your React app__

1. Import the package by running: `npm i cake-or-death`

2. Add an import to your file: `import { isItCake } from "cake-or-death"`

3. Test the import, is it cake or it death?

```
const showCakeOrDeath = (value: string) => isItCake(value) ? 'ðŸŽ‚' : 'ðŸ’€'

console.log(showCakeOrDeath("chocolate")) // ðŸŽ‚

console.log(showCakeOrDeath("chicken")) // ðŸ’€
```

4. You can also add your own definitions of 'cake':

```
const moreCakes = ["peach cobbler", "raspberry pavlova", "jaffa"]

console.log(showCakeOrDeath("jaffa cake", moreCakes)) // ðŸŽ‚

console.log(showCakeOrDeath("Rainn Wilson's crusty second-day sock", moreCakes)) // ðŸ’€
```
